                        <h3>Hi there! I'm Erika. It's great to meet you.</h3>
                        <p>I'm a web designer and developer from Seattle, Washington. I make websites that look great, work like a dream, and make my clients more money. Sound like what you need? Let's work together!</p>
                        <p>Before embracing my inner tech nerd, I worked in nonprofit management, investing in people, projects, and communities to make our world a better place. I'm super-lucky to still consult part-time to a few of the best organizations out there.</p>
                        <p>When I'm not wireframing in Photoshop, writing code, or helping students get to and through college, you can find me skiing, drinking kombucha, reading detective novels, or trying to teach my cats to walk on leashes. Or&mdash;my newest obsession&mdash;surfing! (Yep, in the full neoprene getup; Washington waters are cooold!)</p>
